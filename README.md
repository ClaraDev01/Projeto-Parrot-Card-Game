# 🦜 Parrot Card Game 

Parrot Card Game is a memory matching game where players flip cards to find pairs of parrot GIFs. Developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it features smooth card-flip animations, user interaction, and responsive design for mobile devices.

## 🚀 *Technologies Used*

- *HTML5* – Semantic and accessible markup  
- *CSS3* – Styling, layout, and responsive design  
- *JavaScript* – Game logic and interactivity  
- *Google Fonts (Roboto)* – Consistent and modern typography  

## 🎯 *Requirements Met*

- ✅ *Responsive Title and Layout* – Includes media queries for font sizes and spacing on mobile  
- ✅ *Accurate Counting of Moves* – Counts each card flip as a separate move (not per pair)  
- ✅ *Visual Spacing Between Cards* – Uses flexible gap with adjustments for smaller screens  
- ✅ *Card Flip Animation* – Smooth 3D rotation on click  
- ✅ *Prompt for Player Name and Number of Cards* – Validates input for even number between 4 and 14  
- ✅ *End of Game Detection* – Alerts player with moves count and option to restart  
- ✅ *Clean and Modular Code* – Separate files and clear function responsibilities
